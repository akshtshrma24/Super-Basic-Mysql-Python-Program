# Super-Basic-Mysql-Python-Program
This is a Python3 Mysql program for user "root' and host "localhost", you enter your password and which database you would like to go into, then you have the options of Deleting, Inserting, Creating, or Viewing Table. If you see any place in which my code could be more efficient or some questionable things feel free to critique me. I am open to all constructive criticism.
